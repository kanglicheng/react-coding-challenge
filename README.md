## Setup Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhban01/react-coding-challenge.git
cd react-coding-challenge
npm install

## Tools/ frameworks/ libraries used:
* Build tool - Webpack
* Transpilation - Babel
* Linter - eslint
* Test runner - Jest
* Test utility - Enzyme


## Shortcomings:
* Only tested on Google Chrome.
* Not responsive - displays best on desktop/laptop.
* Redux wasn't included.


## What could change given more time:
* Implement RWD - add media queries.
* Add more tests.
* Analyze and reduce bundle size.
* Browser compatibility.
